<h3>So, What is vaxbot?</h3>

<p>Vaxbot is designed to help people save time searching for COVID-19 vaccines. Instead of having to check multiple sites and fill out eligibility forms
on each, vaxbot can confirm vaccine availability BEFORE you go through all that.</p> 

<h3>Who built this and why?</h3>

<p>Vaxbot was built by Austin Carnahan. The original idea was inspired by Huge Ma, the creator of the NYC-based turbovax.com. We've borrowed a lot of ideas
and design from them, huge thanks! We've also learned a lot from Nick Something's vaccinespotter.com and their code has helped us vastly improve our pharmacy searches.</p>


<p>Recently, Missouri has consistly ranked last in measures of percent of population vaccinated. We wanted to bring some of the most forward-thinking tools
to our community and help facilitate the proccess of getting more people vaccinated.</p>

<h3>What makes vabot unique?</h3>

<p>While there are new tools being published every day, we think vaxbot is special in that it automates collection of data at a national level AND has a strong focus on
regional community engagement. We find dedicated volunteers to run regional social media channels which are informed by our national scans and who help us include 
more local resources.</p>

<h3>When I follow your links, I'm still not seeing available vaccine appointments</h3>

<p>We try to update our data as frequently as possible without disrupting the services that provide our information. 
Vaccine appointments fill up very fast. Refresh the site and check back often for the best chance at securing an appointment.</p>


<h3>Am I eligible for a vaccine?</h3>

<p>We don't keep track of state or federal eligibility requirements. Make sure you qualify for vaccines in your area.</p> 

<h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
